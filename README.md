# PixelCode
A esoteric programming language that was heavily inspired by Brainfuck.

This isn't the best esoteric programming language ever, but you can draw on the screen, use the number array like on Brainfuck, and it has two stacks.


The interpreter isn't that fast.
So don't spam the Start Code key please.


CONTROLS:
Numpad 1: Load Code
Numpad 2: Start Code
Numpad 4: Debug (Shows Num Array, Two Stacks)



You can switch between stacks.

Stack #1 is mainly used for arguments of functions.

Stack #2 is for anything you need it.

You can push/pop from both stacks.


There's an indicator in the bottom right corner which will tell you if the code is running or not.


Green - Running Code


Red - Not running any code


Blue - Waiting for the user to click on the screen


Dark Orange - Waiting for the user to click an input on the Input Panel
