# PixelCode
A esoteric programming language that was heavily inspired by Brainfuck.

This isn't the best esoteric programming language ever, but you can draw on the screen, use the number array like on Brainfuck, and it has two stacks.

You can switch between stacks.

Stack #1 is mainly used for arguments of functions.
Stack #2 is for anything you need it.
You can push/pop from both stacks.

If you want to read more please open the Documentation.txt file.
